Invalid primary clock on hierarchical pin  
A primary clock clk_65mhz_mod/inst/clk_in1 is created on an inappropriate internal pin clk_65mhz_mod/inst/clk_in1. It is not recommended to create a primary clock on a hierarchical pin when its driver pin has a fanout connected to multiple clock pins

The clocks originate from two parallel MMCMs or PLLs and at least one of the block's clock dividers is not set to 1. To be safely timed, all parallel MMCMs or PLLs must have the clock divider set to 1.
